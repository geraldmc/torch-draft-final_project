## Welcome to the **[Project Page ...](https://)**

This notebook is associated with the project submission of MOHAMMED RASHED and GERALD MCCOLLAM and for the class `EN.525.733.8VL.SP22 Deep Learning for Computer Vision`. Our semester project is [Weed Object Detection w/ YOLOv5](https://).

Please note that the codeblocks in this notebook have a 1:1 relationship with the submitted code on Blackboard with two exceptions: (1) Python classes here are not separated as in the zipped file submission on Blackboard, and (2) Command Line Argument parsing here is replaced with an `args` dictionary.

This notebook may be executed by pressing ▶️ block-by-block, without adjusting `args` inputs. It may also be executed with `Run all` under ` Runtime` in the menu.
