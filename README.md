<b>DCGAN</b>

1. DCGAN.ipynb: the DCGAN notebook is used for training the generator/discriminator. The Notebook requires the data file to be in the same directory as the notebook. The images should be stored as "data/train/[class label]/" directory structure. The notebook will also save the generator model in "MOdel" folder. 
Dependency for DCGAN: dcgan_network.py in the same directory.

1.1 DCGAN Evaluation.ipynb: this notebook is used for evaluating the DCGAN generator model. The notebook will require a trained generator model file "Model/deepweeds_DCGAN_gan_0.pth" to exisit in the model folder. Please ensure. The DCGAN.ipynb must be run first if the trained model does not exisit.
